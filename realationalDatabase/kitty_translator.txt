g flag to replace all words containing pattern , without g only first instance will be replaced
to replace 2 words with same word => s/meow|meowzer/woof/g
to replace multiple patterns => sed 's/<pattern_1>/<replacement_1>/; s/<pattern_2>/<replacement_2>/'
echo "$(echo '   M e ' | sed 's/^ *//g')." => ^ is for indecating spaces in front of the text only, it removes one space, * at the end of pattern indecates to remove all spaces from front
